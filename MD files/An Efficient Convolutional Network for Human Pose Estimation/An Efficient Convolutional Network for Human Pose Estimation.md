**An Efficient Convolutional Network for Human Pose Estimation**

1.what is the problem/topic?

à The problem is to find an efficient convulation  network for HPE.

\2. why is it relevant? 

à It is relevant to use an efficient convulation network that work on machines with low computational powers.

\3. what have other people done to solve the problem?

àThe classical approaches are based on the pictorial structure model that uses a tree-structured graphical model to encode spatial dependencies between neighbouring joints. Another line of research is based on hierarchical models that first detect larger body parts in the image and then condition the detection of smaller body parts on the detected larger body parts. Complex non-tree models have also been used that model spatial dependencies between unconnected body parts.

4.why is this not sufficient?

à The above methods are not sufficient because they need a high computational machines that use a high rate GPU and it takes the system a higher time to  compute the pose estimation.

\5. what is the proposed solution? 

à The proposed solution is to find a convulation network that is efficient and does not compromise on the aspects of accuracy and efficiency.

\6. why is the solution better?

à It is a better solution as we propose an efficient deep network architecture that can be efficiently trained on mid-range GPUs without the need of any pre-training. Despite the low computational requirements of our network, it is on par with much more complex models on popular benchmarks for human pose estimation.

\7. what is left/future work? 

à This a baseline model and a lot of work will go into making it a better scalable approach for more advanced and high complex models.
