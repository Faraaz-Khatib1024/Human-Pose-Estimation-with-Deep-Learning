1.what is the problem/topic?

-->Deep Learning-Based Human Pose Estimation: A Survey




\2. why is it relevant? 

--> It gives a comprehensive overview of many different 2d and 3d estimation solutions and inference method. more than 240 papers have been researched since 2014 to concise it.




This paper combines and gives an overview and can be used to dissect and reasearch individual methids and solutions for human pose estimation problems.




This paper can be used as a basis to compare and differentiate between models, datasets and evaluation metrics.
