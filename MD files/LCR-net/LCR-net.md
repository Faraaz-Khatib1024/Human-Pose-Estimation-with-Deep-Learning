**LCR-Net++: Multi-person 2D and 3D Pose Detection in Natural Images**

1.what is the problem/topic?

à To use LCR-Net++ for Multi-person 2D and 3D Pose Detection in Natural Images.

\2. why is it relevant? 

àThe above paper is relevant as its centred around the formation of 2D and 3D pose detection. 

\3. what have other people done to solve the problem?

àRelated works to solve the problem of 2D and 3D pose detection are Human localization and 2D pose estimation which are state-of-the-art approaches for 2D human pose estimation, employing CNN architectures and the other solution is 3D human pose estimation from a single image, which can be decomposed into two groups: (a) the ones that first compute 2D poses and use them to estimate 3D poses and (b) approaches that directly learn mappings from image features to 3D poses.

4.why is this not sufficient?

à The above methods in general require a localization of movements and humans to do the pose estimation.

\5. what is the proposed solution?

à The proposed solution is to use LCR-Net, which allows the pose estimation of multiple people simultaneously without the need for localization. 

\6. why is the solution better?

à The solution is better because it recovers full body image which is partially occluded or truncated by the boundary. It also outperforms many state of the art 3D estimators

\7. what is left/future work? 

à We need to adequately score the pose proposals and use better real world data which can help us in finding better better accuracy and efficiency in the model. 

\8. keywords or points you didn't understand?

à Pose proposals.
