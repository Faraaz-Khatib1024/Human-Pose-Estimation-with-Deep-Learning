1.what is the problem/topic?

à Can 3D Pose be Learned from 2D Projections Alone?

\2. why is it relevant? 

à The problems faced for 3D pose estimation on its own are a few and its easier to do 2D pose estimation and its relevant to use  the 2D projections to try and find 3D poses.

\3. what have other people done to solve the problem?

à Few previously used techniques are 3D Pose Estimation: Directly estimate 3D joint locations from images in an end-to-end learning framework. Fully Supervised: Use approaches such as that use paired 2D-3D data comprised of ground truth 2D locations of joint landmarks and corresponding 3D ground truth for learning. 

4.why is this not sufficient?

àThe methods are mainly focused on direct 3D pose estimation than 2D information.

\5. what is the proposed solution?

à The proposed solution is to use weak supervised lifting of 2D pose to 3D skeleton using adversarial loss. 

\6. why is the solution better?

àThis solution is better because it uses available 2D pose to translate into 3D skeleton which is tougher to do directly on a 3D model.

\7. what is left/future work? 

à To use temporal information to find a better accuracy paradigm and efficiency.

\8. keywords or points you didn't understand?

à Adversial Loss, temporal information.
